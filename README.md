# DragonDungeon

## About

DragonDungeon is a free-to-play game from the LEAGUE of Amazing Programmers. This branch (master) contains the latest code of DragonDungeon 1.0.0 (November 2021) onwards. The legacy branch contains DragonDungeon code from versions 0.0.1 - 1.0.0 (December 2020 - October 2021). The master branch contains an outdated version that will be updated soon. The legacy branch is intended as a historical record - not a functioning game. It is no longer supported and has known bugs.
